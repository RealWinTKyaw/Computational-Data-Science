## PyTorch Model v1 (simple CNN)
Dataset was split into two separate sets - the first containing 781/1081 real images along with all 720 easy and medium difficulty images, and the second containing the remaining 300/1081 real images and all 240 hard difficult images. A simple CNN was trained on both datasets in round-robin fashion. Total test accuracy of 65.7% was achieved.<br>
